# WLAN fingerprint positioning
Based on [UjiIndoorLoc data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/giantuji/UjiIndoorLoc), this repository contains a machine learning model which predicts indoor positioning from WLAN fingerprints. The final mean error when predicting the validation data came down to ~12 meters. Plots displaying loss and learning curves are included at the end of the notebook.
